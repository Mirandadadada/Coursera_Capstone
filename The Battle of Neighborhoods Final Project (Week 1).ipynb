    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "New York City is the nation's largest short-term rental market, facilitated by hosting websites such as Airbnb, Booking.com and etc. According to data from analytics website AirDNA, New York City had over 38,000 Airbnb listings and generated over 800 million U.S. dollars as of June 2019. With such a variety of options, it is challenging but crucial for visitors to find the most suitable accommodation to optimize their visiting experience. In this project, I will leverage the data from Foursquare and Airbnb to help visitors to screen out the most desirable accommodation based on their preference.\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem to be Solved\n",
    "I will stay in New York for a day to explore the lower Manhattan area as much as possible, so I want to find an Airbnb in Manhattan based on my following criteria: \n",
    "+ Budget: between 150 USD and 500 USD per night\n",
    "+ Room type: entire home or apartment\n",
    "+ Reviews: at least 5 reviews before\n",
    "+ Restaurants: the nearby restaurants should be similar to the ones in Manhattanville where I lived before\n",
    "+ Venues: the more, the better\n",
    "### 1.3 Potential Audience\n",
    "The methodology and tools used in this project are helpful for any individual or family who wants to relocate to a new city to find the best accommodations based on their personal preference. Likewise, this approch is instrumental in seeking out the best location for companies that want to open a new business in a city. Meanwhile, the mapping and clustering techniques can also be used in comparing locations, cities, or neighborhood to assist stakeholders in making decisions.<br><br>\n",
